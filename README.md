## Running the Arduino Sketch
If you have correctly installed the libraries, the example sketeches should now be available from within Arduino.
If its not showing, please, [Download the Arduino Sketch from our repository here](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral-ads1293-arduino) and place it in the arduino libraries folder.

Open up your Arduino IDE and run the Arudino sketch (.ino) file in the archive that you downloaded. Your Arduino should now be programmed to read the ecg data and sending over the USB-UART.


## Using the ProtoCentral OpenView GUI
The GUI for visualizing the ads1293 data is written in Processing, based on Java and is cross-compilable across platforms.
